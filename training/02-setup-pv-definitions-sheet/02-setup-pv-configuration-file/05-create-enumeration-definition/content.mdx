# Part 5: Create Enumeration Definition

We’ve now laid the groundwork by defining the model element types—our logical functions—that we want to enhance with new values and properties. The exciting part is that we can establish these new values using **Enumeration Definitions**.

Enumeration Definition:
- **Enumeration Definitions** are like dropdown menus for properties. Instead of typing in a value every time, you select from a set list of options.
- **Example**: Imagine you have a property called "Safety Level" for your functions. With an enumeration definition, you can create a list of possible values like "High," "Medium," and "Low." Whenever you assign this property, you just pick one of these options from the list. Pretty cool, right?

**Here is how you can create an Enumeration Definition:**

Right-click on the domain (<CaIcon name="domain" />) and select the option to create an Enumeration Definition (<CaIcon name="createEnumerationDefinition" />). Then give it a name!

Your turn! Go ahead and create a new Enumeration Definition and name it "Type Literals".

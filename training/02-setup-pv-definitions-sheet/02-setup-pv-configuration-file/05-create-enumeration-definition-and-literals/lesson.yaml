        Create an Enumeration Definition named "Type Literals". Create four Enumeration Literals under the newly created Enumeration Definition and name them Security, Temperature, Light, and Audio
      hint: |
        You can create an Enumeration Definition with a right-click on the domain (<CaIcon name="domain" />) and select the option to create an Enumeration Definition (<CaIcon name="createEnumerationDefinition" />). Then, just rename it in the text field on the right.        Create four new Enumeration Definitions and name them Security, Temperature, Light, and Audio. Start by right-clicking on your newly created definition (<CaIcon name="enumerationDefinition" />). Now, one by one, create your Enumeration Literals (<CaIcon name="createEnumerationLiteral" />) each one representing a specific value you want to define in your model.

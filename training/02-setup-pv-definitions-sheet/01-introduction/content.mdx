Welcome to the second chapter! In the first chapter, we took an in-depth look at the benefits of Property Value Management in Capella. Now, in the second chapter, we're taking it a step further: we'll show you how to create and configure such a system from scratch. Don’t worry—we'll continue using our familiar smart home example so you can smoothly follow along.

You’re happy with your Smart Home System and that you could reduce energy consumption. Now, you're thinking about taking it to the next level by adding more features—especially a security system to keep your home safe. To do this, you’ll need to expand your logical architecture to include these new security functionalities. You've already made some updates to your architecture in the Capella model. Now, let’s jump into the logical architecture and start enhancing it even further.

Open the Logical Architecture Diagram: Start by locating and opening the LAB XYZ diagram to get a clear view of your current logical architecture. As you explore the diagram, you'll see that many of the logical components, functions, and interfaces are already set up. Now, let’s add an exciting new feature: a motion-activated camera that only turns on when movement is detected, conserving energy and making your system even smarter.

To add the missing functionality, start by creating a new function called "Detect Events", which will handle the identification of motion or other important occurrences. Next, introduce a Logical Component named "Event Detection System" into your architecture. Once both are in place, make sure to assign the "Detect Events" function to this newly created logical component, linking the two and ensuring your system is set up to detect and process significant events effectively.

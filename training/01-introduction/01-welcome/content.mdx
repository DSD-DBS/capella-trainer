Hello and welcome to this course!

It's fantastic that you're eager to dive deeper into Capella and explore its many great possibilities! In a step-by-step tutorial we will learn all things concerning custom property value capture, management and export in Capella.

In this tutorial, you'll dive into working with extended objects and attributes, gaining the skills to create your own attribute groups and seamlessly apply them to model elements. You'll learn how to take your modeling to the next level by applying extensions conditionally, based on other attribute values, and customising the appearance of elements in your diagrams using property value management. Finally, you'll discover how to efficiently extract property value data, transforming it into clear, usable documents or tables.

Since you've already been introduced to Capella in previous courses and have a good understanding of the basics, we recommend that you review these basics if you haven't done so recently. We'll be building on these basics, so it's important to be familiar with them.

In this tutorial, we will intentionally simplify certain aspects to provide a clear and straightforward demonstration of the benefits and functionalities of the Property-Value Management extension. This approach is necessary to ensure that the core concepts are easily understood without being overwhelmed by the complexities of the full production environment. By focusing on the essentials, we can more effectively showcase how this powerful tool can enhance your Capella experience.

In this first lesson, we’ll focus on demonstrating the advantages and possibilities of property value management. We’ll explore three practical examples:

- Color-Coding
- Adding Custom Values
- Analysing Models

By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of what’s possible. To finish this chapter, you’ll take a quick quiz to reinforce what you’ve learned.

Let's get started!

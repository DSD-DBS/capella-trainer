# Summary and Quiz

As you can see, we can leverage the Property Value Management (PVM) Addon for a variety of purposes. Through our straightforward examples, we've demonstrated several powerful uses for PVMT:

- **Visualisation with Predefined Rules**: By utilising predefined rules, we can enhance the visualisation of our models. This makes complex diagrams easier to read and understand, enabling us to quickly identify important elements and their relationships. For instance, we used colour coding to differentiate between different interfaces, making the diagrams more intuitive.
- **Customised Values**: We've shown how to extend Capella models with customised values, like adding standby energy consumption for each device. This allows you to tailor the model to fit your specific needs and capture relevant data that isn't included by default.
- **Access and Analyse Model Values**: We've also illustrated how to access model values using the Python4Capella add-on. This powerful tool lets us extract and analyse customised properties, such as energy consumption, to gain valuable insights. We created diagrams summarising energy usage by room and device, helping us pinpoint areas for improvement.
Through these examples, it's clear that the Property Value Management Add-on is an invaluable tool for customising, visualising, and analysing Capella models. By integrating this add-on into your modelling work, you will enhance the functionality and efficiency of your development.

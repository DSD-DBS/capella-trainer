Hello and welcome to this course!

It's fantastic that you're eager to dive deeper into Capella and explore its many possibilities! Since you've already been introduced to Capella in previous courses and have a good understanding of the basics, we recommend that you review these basics if you haven't done so recently. We'll be building on these basics, so it's important to be familiar with them.

In a step-by-step tutorial we will lern all things concerning custom property value capture, management and export in Capella. In this tutorial, we will intentionally simplify certain aspects to provide a clear and straightforward demonstration of the benefits and functionalities of the Property-Value Management extension. This approach is necessary to ensure that the core concepts are easily understood without being overwhelmed by the complexities of the full production environment. By focusing on the essentials, we can more effectively showcase how this powerful tool can enhance your Capella experience.

This course is divided into distinct sections to guide you through the learning process. These sections are labelled as follows:

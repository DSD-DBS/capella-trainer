# Part 1: Add custom value

Imagine you've been enjoying your smart home system for several years, enjoying its convenience. But lately you've noticed that your electricity bills are getting higher every month. With electricity prices on the rise and a growing awareness of your impact on the environment, you're motivated to make your home more energy efficient. You've learned that many appliances can use surprising amounts of power, even when they're in standby mode. To tackle this, you decide to identify the energy hungry devices in your system and replace them with more energy-efficient alternatives. To start, you'll expand your Capella model to include power consumption details for each device. This makes it easy to track and analyse which devices are the biggest energy wasters, even when they're not in use. This allows you to make informed decisions about upgrading to newer, more efficient equipment, ultimately saving you money on your energy bills and reducing your carbon footprint. Let's start making your smart home system smarter and greener!

Capella provides a limited set of predefined properties for your model elements. For instance, a property like "standby energy consumption" isn’t included by default, but it can be added using the Property Value Management Extension.

Fortunately, your Property Value Management already has a field for entering standby energy consumption. Later, we’ll learn how to create and manage such custom properties.

For now, most of your values are already set—only the standby energy consumption for the Radio in the living room is missing. Let’s go ahead and add that.

#  Part 3: Show links

As you can see, the "Devices_type" setting is only selectable after setting the Types_Enum to Devices. This demonstrates how PVMT allows us to establish predefined rules. This feature becomes incredibly powerful as our models grow in complexity. By setting these rules, we ensure that certain properties are only selectable for the desired model elements, maintaining consistency and preventing errors. Imagine managing a large, intricate model without such rulesâ€”it would be chaotic and prone to mistakes. PVMT helps us maintain order, making sure that properties are correctly applied, which is essential for accurate analysis and visualisation. In larger projects, this capability is invaluable. It ensures that our models remain organised and that properties are applied consistently, leading to more reliable, efficient and robust system designs.

Cool, now we want to visualise the connection types between the controller and the different devices, to ensure our "Controller" is able to handle all of the devices.

Please show the physical links now. Physical links represent the connection type and are already implemented in the model for this purpose. They are currently hidden. To reveal these elements, navigate to the filter options and uncheck "Collapse Component Physical Ports" and "Hide Physical Links." This will make everything visible for easier exploration.

# Simple demonstration exercise for colour coding

_To start really simple, lets think about the following situation_: You are the owner of a house and you are trying to set up a smart home automation system. The system consists of intelligent lights that shall be centrally controlled, automatically switched on and off or adjusted in brightness; thermostats that control room temperature and adjust heating or cooling based on preset temperature targets; security cameras that shall monitor the home, trigger alarms or record when motion is detected; and automated windows and doors that shall be opened and closed remotely or automatically based on weather conditions or security requirements.

To support your development and architecture decisions you have build a Capella MBSE model and already included a configuration for the property value management tool (PVMT) extension. So, everything is already preset for this task. We show the advantages of PVMT using just the example of physical architecture. However, the procedure can generally be applied to all layers and model elements. And, don't worry, we will later learn step-by-step how to set up and configure all of this.

# Color-Coding

See how simple colour coding can dramatically enhance readability in complex diagrams? Now, imagine applying this powerful technique to our railway development project. By using distinct colours, we could effortlessly highlight standardised interfaces and proprietary interfaces. This would not only make our diagrams more visually intuitive but also help us quickly identify and differentiate between various interface types, streamlining the entire development process.
